        <h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
        <p>Full Stack Web Development involves designing and building both the front end and the back end of websites and applications. It focuses on creating complete, functional systems where the user interface, server, and database work seamlessly together. Full Stack developers manage everything from interactive, user-friendly designs to secure data handling and server-side logic, ensuring performance, scalability, and smooth integration across all layers of the web.</p>

            <h2>node.js</h2>
            <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. It forms the backbone of many modern web applications by enabling server-side development with JavaScript. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture to handle multiple requests efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications such as APIs, real-time chat systems, and streaming services.</p>

            <h2>Back End Development</h2>
            <p>Back End Web Development is used to manage the server-side operations of a website or application. It focuses on processing requests, handling databases, managing authentication, and ensuring secure communication between the server and the client. Back End development enables the logic that powers user interactions, such as storing data, retrieving information, and running application workflows. It ensures performance, scalability, and reliability, allowing front end interfaces to function smoothly and efficiently.</p>

            <h2>express js.</h2>
            <p>Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies building server-side applications by providing tools to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and integrate middleware for added functionality. Express.js is widely used to create APIs and web servers, making backend development faster, more organized, and efficient.</p>
