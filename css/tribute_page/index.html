            <p>Marie Curie (1867–1934) was a pioneering physicist and chemist. She discovered polonium and radium, won Nobel Prizes in both Physics and Chemistry, and revolutionized science and medicine. During World War I, she developed mobile X-ray units for battlefield medical use and inspired generations of scientists, especially women in science.</p>

        <h2>Here's a time line of Marie Curie's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1867 – Born in Warsaw, Poland, as Maria Skłodowska.</li><br>
            <li>1891 – Moves to Paris to attend the Sorbonne University, studying physics and mathematics.</li><br>
            <li>1894 – Meets Pierre Curie, her future husband and research partner.</li><br>
            <li>1895 – Marries Pierre Curie. Together, they begin experiments on uranium rays.</li><br>
            <li>1898 – Discovers the elements polonium (named after her homeland Poland) and radium.</li><br>
            <li>1903 – Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for work on radioactivity. She becomes the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</li><br>
            <li>1906 – Pierre Curie dies in a street accident. Marie continues their work alone, taking his place as a professor at the University of Paris, becoming the first female professor there.</li><br>
            <li>1911 – Wins a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her work in isolating pure radium. She is the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences.</li><br>
            <li>1914-1918 – During World War I, develops mobile X-ray units, called "Little Curies," to assist battlefield doctors.</li><br>
            <li>1920s – Advocates for scientific research, teaches and inspires the next generation of scientists, especially women in science.</li><br>
            <li>1934 – Dies at age 66 from aplastic anemia, caused by prolonged exposure to radioactive materials.</li>
        </ul>
