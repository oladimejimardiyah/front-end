        <p>What is the map method and how does it function?
            The map() method in JavaScript is a commonly used array function that allows you to transform data efficiently. It works by applying a specified callback function to every element in an existing array, generating a new array with the transformed results. Importantly, the original array remains unchanged â€” the method simply returns a fresh array containing the output of the operation performed on each element.</p>
